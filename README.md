This is a scrap data app using puppeteer library.

# This is a simple web application that allows users to  scrap data to search for job listings based on their input. Here's how to get started with the application:

- Clone the Repo:
  To get started with the application, you can clone the repo by using the given link.

- Start the Server:
Once you have cloned the repo, navigate to the project directory and start the server by running node scraper.js in your terminal.

In the application, you can search for jobs by typing in your query in the input field and clicking on the search button. The application will then fetch job listings from various job websites based on your search query.

- List of Jobs:
Once the application has fetched job listings, they will be displayed as a list of job cards. Each job card will display information about the job, such as the job title, company name, and location.

- View Job Details:
If you click on a job card, it will display more details about the job, such as the job description, job requirements, and how to apply for the job.

That's it! You're now ready to use the Job Scraper application. If you encounter any issues, feel free to raise an issue on the repo, and we will be happy to help you out.
